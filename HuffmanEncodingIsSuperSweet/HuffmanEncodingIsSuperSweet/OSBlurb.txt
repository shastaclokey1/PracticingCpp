Come code with Oxy Open Source! The reason for workspace is to have a designated time for Oxy CS students to be in the same place and work on relevant projects/homework. Our resources include snacks, peer tutors, study sessions for specific Oxy CS Courses, and other CS related things you might need. We want all computer science students participation, regardless of CS background!
